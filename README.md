# **üñ•Ô∏è Personal Portfolio**  

This is a single-page portfolio built with **React**, designed to showcase my work in a clean and minimalist way, focusing only on the essentials. The page features a **downloadable resume (PDF)**, a **project showcase**, and a **contact section** in the footer, where visitors can reach out or explore my social media links.  

For smooth and engaging interactions, I used **Framer Motion** to create a custom animated cursor, enhancing the browsing experience. Additionally, **AOS Library** was implemented for lightweight scroll animations, making the website more dynamic while maintaining optimal performance.
